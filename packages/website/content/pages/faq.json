This includes an easy-to-use, performant storage service that makes data available on IPFS and persists it on the Filecoin decentralized storage network. NFT.Storage is a service whose mission to perpetually store all off-chain NFT data as a public good (so for free, forever). It currently runs on the Web3.Storage platform today, but has future plans to provide its services in a fully decentralized manner (run by a DAO with operations and governance instrumented on smart contracts)."

It's currently not possible to delete files via the API or the client libraries, but we are working on enabling that feature in the near future.<br><br>However, once a file is uploaded to Web3.Storage, there cannot be a guarantee that all copies of the file are gone from the IPFS network. As soon as a file is uploaded, other IPFS nodes can access and store a copy of the data. The data only becomes unavailable when the last IPFS node has stopped pinning the file, and all copies are garbage collected. As a consequence you should only upload to Web3.Storage files that you know can be shared with anyone forever, or are securely encrypted.<br><br>We are in the process of rolling out a new client and service called w3up that allows you to unlink uploads from being associated with your account. The Alpha version CLI can be found <a href='https://github.com/nftstorage/w3up-cli' alt='w3up' target='_blank'>here. Later, the current Javascript client will use w3up and all existing uploads and accounts will be migrated to the new service.""
